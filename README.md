## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SCSS

### What I learned

- Use CSS grid to create a custom grid layout.
- Combining CSS grid with flexbox.

### Continued development

Maybe some intermediate media query to make the responsive more elegant.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Grid generator](https://cssgrid-generator.netlify.app/) - This helped me to create a custom grid layout.
